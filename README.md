This is a devops project that requires the deplyment of a kubernetes cluster from AWS through the use of terraform.
The cluster has three worker nodes, and has a cloud native image registry "Harbor" installed within a namespace.

Argocd is deployed for CD, and work is going on to complete the deployment, secure the deployment and integrate the CD with gitactions for CI.

I will update this section with other informations as i progress with the project.
